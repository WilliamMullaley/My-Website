        <p><q> <Body>This painting includes two oblong turtles, a male and female. They are found where I live and where my cultural heritage is from, in Noongar regions of Western Australia. It is also my spirt animal (Turtle) as well as my totem. A totem by English definition is "a natural object or animal that is believed by a particular society to have spiritual significance and that is adopted as an emblem." In my Indigenous culture it represents what a person must respect, obey, and protect. For example I must not eat/consume a turtle, and if we were to find a turtle I must help it or protect it. If we were to decide to eat it, I would prepare it and gather only what was required and use all of the animal. But it does not only apply to animals, others totems include water, trees, places and more.

        <p><q> <Body>This painting tells the story told by my grandfather, Edward James Mullaley. The story is about the man in the sky, he lays in the sky during a time of year where you can't hunt certain animals and then when he stands up, then you can hunt these animals. It also shows the stars, which are the spirits of our ancestors who have passed on. Their spirit flies into the sky and joins their family camp which is a star.
